        <h1>Eagles</h1>

        <p>The eagles are my favorite rock band, they have countless hits and I love 
            the sound and harmony that they make with every song. <br> Their Greatest Hits 
            (1976) is the best-selling album in the United States, with 38 million sold, 
            and primed the public for the late 1976 <br> release of Hotel California, which 
            would sell more than 26 million copies in the US.</p>
